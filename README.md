# 20Time-Project

## Week 1 Log
This week I have submited my **20time projct** to google class room. I plan to make a 2D game that will have a running character that will  try to avoid lazer that will be shot at him. The game will also have a upgrade shop where you can buy greater speed, more health etc.. I have not started researching of how I am going to make the game but I am planning to do that this weekend.
